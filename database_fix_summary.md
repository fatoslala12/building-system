# Database Fix Summary - NOT NULL Constraint Issues

## Problem Description

The application was encountering database constraint violations when trying to add employees to workplaces and insert working hours:

### Error 1: employee_workplaces table
```
error: null value in column "id" of relation "employee_workplaces" violates not-null constraint
```

### Error 2: work_hours table  
```
error: null value in column "id" of relation "work_hours" violates not-null constraint
```

## Root Cause Analysis

Investigation revealed that both tables had:
- `id` columns defined as `integer NOT NULL` 
- But missing `DEFAULT` values for auto-generation
- Sequences existed (`building_system.employee_workplaces_id_seq` and `building_system.work_hours_id_seq`) but were not linked to the columns

The INSERT operations in the code were correctly not providing `id` values (expecting auto-generation), but the database schema was not configured to auto-generate them.

## Applied Fix

### SQL Changes Applied:
```sql
-- Fix employee_workplaces table
ALTER TABLE employee_workplaces 
ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('building_system.employee_workplaces_id_seq');

-- Fix work_hours table  
ALTER TABLE work_hours 
ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('building_system.work_hours_id_seq');

-- Ensure sequences are properly initialized
SELECT setval('building_system.employee_workplaces_id_seq', COALESCE((SELECT MAX(id) FROM employee_workplaces), 1), false);
SELECT setval('building_system.work_hours_id_seq', COALESCE((SELECT MAX(id) FROM work_hours), 1), false);
```

### Files Affected:
- **backend/controllers/employeeWorkplaceController.js** - No changes needed (INSERT code was correct)
- **backend/controllers/workHoursController.js** - No changes needed (INSERT code was correct)
- **Database schema** - Fixed DEFAULT constraints on id columns

## Verification

Both INSERT operations tested successfully:
- ✅ `employee_workplaces` INSERT generates auto-incrementing id
- ✅ `work_hours` INSERT generates auto-incrementing id

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The database now properly auto-generates id values for both tables. The existing application code will work correctly without any changes needed.
